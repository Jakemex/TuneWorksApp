      "description": "Description GTurbo 1GD-FTV Power-Pipe – Maximum Flow, Maximum Potential The factory intake pipe on the Toyota 1GD-FTV diesel is undersized and restrictive, limiting the turbocharger’s ability to breathe freely. The GTurbo Power-Pipe solves this with a cast, bolt-on 3.5-inch inlet designed for maximum airflow and effortless performance gains. Engineered to be a direct fit, the Power-Pipe comes complete with our reinforced silicone connector to join seamlessly to the GTurbo High-Flow Airbox. The silicone section is internally supported with steel rings, preventing collapse or distortion under heavy load or high boost pressures. Why it matters A turbo that breathes easier doesn’t have to work as hard to make boost. That means: More power & torque – Unlock up to 220 kW and 700 Nm with supporting modifications, without the airflow bottlenecks of the factory pipe. Improved fuel efficiency – Reduced turbo effort can translate to better economy on and off-road. Lower intake temps – More efficient airflow helps keep temperatures in check, especially under sustained load. Key Features 3.5-inch cast alloy construction – Strong, precise, and smooth-flowing for maximum efficiency. Bolt-on fitment – No cutting or fabrication required. Steel-reinforced silicone connector – Maintains shape under pressure and heat, ensuring long-term reliability. Designed for performance builds – Supports high-flow GTurbo setups without restricting airflow. Whether you’re chasing peak numbers or simply want your 1GD-FTV to run cooler, stronger, and more efficiently, the GTurbo Power-Pipe is the missing link between your airbox and turbo.

It helps force the incoming air down into the motor, giving the Landcruiser increased responsiveness, and allowing the engine to breathe easier. The air ram is noticeably quieter at highway speeds than the factory Toyota snorkel head. A vent at the rear of the snorkel head ensures an exit for water during driving in rain. The Manta Air Ram is a simple 5 minute install, retaining the use of the factory clamping system. Just loosen the clamp, remove the old snorkel head, replace it with the new air ram, tighten the clamp, and away you go! Height: 145mm exc. snorkel insert section",

Designed for Australia’s harsh off-road conditions, this filter captures even the finest dust while maintaining superior flow for tuned and high-output engines. Key Features Advanced Multi-Layered Media: Utilises Freudenberg’s latest synthetic fibre technology with electrostatic surface charging to trap both coarse dust and sub-micron particles that standard filters miss. High Flow Efficiency: Engineered to optimise intake flow, supporting greater power and throttle response in both stock and tuned applications. Durable Construction: Built for longevity and repeated service intervals, the Scavenger filter media maintains its structure and performance in extreme heat, vibration, and dusty conditions. Why It’s Needed Factory filters struggle to balance airflow and filtration, restricting performance or allowing dust to pass in fine desert conditions. GTurbo’s High-Performance Filter solves both issues, offering superior filtration efficiency and maximum airflow, ensuring reliable protection and sustained power even in the toughest environments. Note:This is a dry-style air filter; it does not require oiling and should not be washed or oiled. Available Applications:GTurbo High-Performance Filters are available for the N80 Hilux and VDJ70 LandCruiser platforms, offering direct-fit compatibility and superior protection for each engine setup.",

We’ve made our own plug and play replacement AC Amplifier that lowers your evaporator temperature by 5 degrees. The AC Amplifier is what Toyota call the air con controller and the factory unit limits the evaporator temperature to around 6-7 deg. With the Freezebrain installed your air conditioner will allow you to adjust your AC dial all the way down to 1 degree! The Freezebrain retains all the stock controls and functionality, 100% plug and play. Super easy to install, the hardest bit is finding your 10mm socket. The AC Amp is behind the passenger speaker, unbolt it, unclip the end of the housing, slide out the Toyota controller and slide ours in. We added led’s to help you diagnose air con faults and also added an idle control switch which lets you keep the idle up slightly as if the compressor was on, even when it’s not. This can be really helpful for keeping the alternator charge up at idle. Full installation and operation instructions are in the box. DOES NOT FIT THE 2.8L 70 Series",

      "description": "Description Toyota Prado 150 Series PDI Heavy Duty Transmission Cooler suit 5 speed A750 and 6 speed AC60 Specific for the KDJ150 series Prado we have chosen to move the thermo fan to the other side of the engine bay. This adds an extra task to the install, but the position is ideal for the engine power delivery as it sits in front of the intercooler and makes the transmission hose plumbing short and tidy. For GDJ150 Prado, the port on the condenser, makes moving the fan to the passenger side very difficult, due to space limitations and would require the installation of a aftermarket fan. NOTE: A number of other aftermarket systems place their transmission cooler in front of the cold side of the intercooler. We have had a number of retired mechanics realise the effects of this and looking to upgrade their intercooler since the higher intake air temps result in less torque and the transmission come out of lockup, which makes even more heat – they ended up with both intercooler and transmission cooler from PDI. By default, all PDI external transmission coolers are designed to be market leading through: · Maximum efficiency 29,000BTU (energy dissipation unit of measure). – Stacked Plate coolers – this is the best design you can use. · Steel one-piece brackets (zinc plated and coated) to eliminate flexing of the aluminium cooler. · High quality transmission cooler hose (rated to 400psi). · Outlets on the side to prevent air locks inside the transmission cooler. NOTE: Having the outlets at the bottom make the installation easier as the pipes are run down under the radiator, but if you get an airlock (from initial installation empty) there is a strong chance you will never actually fill the top of the coolers with fluid and designed cooler efficiency may never be reached. Suitable for the following engines: 1GD-FTV 2.8L Diesel, 1KD-FTV 3.0L Diesel and 1GR-FE 4.0L Petrol Additional införmation below PLUS: PDI have developed an upgraded front mounted intercooler kit for the 150 Prado that will allow the engine to maintain its higher torque and power output under load. This means your gearbox is more likely to remain locked up while pulling up long hills and therefore significantly reduce transmission temperatures. For more info CLICK HERE",

NOTE: other Australian supplied transmission coolers kits for the Ford Ranger use 4.5-5.0m of 10mm hose to get from the gearbox to front of the car. They also released them with restrictive, smaller coolers (16,000BTU rated) and when it was realised that their cooling was insufficient for many installs, a second cooler was added IN SERIES, which makes their heat capability close to our unit but too restrictive By default, all PDI external transmission coolers are designed to be market leading through: · Maximum efficiency 45,000BTU (energy dissipation unit of measure). – Stacked Plate coolers – this is the best design you can use. · Steel one-piece brackets (zinc plated and coated) to eliminate flexing of the aluminium cooler. · High quality transmission cooler hose (rated to 400psi). · Outlets on the top to prevent air locks inside the transmission cooler. NOTE: Having the outlets at the bottom make the installation easier as the pipes are run down under the radiator, but if you get an airlock (from initial installation empty) there is a strong chance you will never actually fill the top of the coolers with fluid and designed cooler efficiency may never be reached. This is the best cooler we have ever seen and does an exceptional job at dropping transmission temperatures. A number of years ago, a friend needed massive cooling for his offroad race vehicle, which was auto and running a high powered 4.2L turbo diesel engine – in my 1 ride in this vehicle out the back of “the pines”, as well as being very fast in and out of the corners, I just thought how hard he was on the transmission. He asked for a large (550x300x76mm) bar and plate intercooler, which he sealed the outlets and ran transmission fluid through it. After a few races he decided he needed more cooling so we supplied the 45,000BTU transmission cooler above, which he claimed made a big difference. A couple years later, he reported that at some point, due to mounting and the weight of the fluid filled intercooler it formed a crack, so he had to bypass it during a race and it made no difference to the overall cooling as the properly designed and suitably sized stacked plate core did such a good job. At that point the much larger bar and plate cooler was never refitted. · Once our upgraded intercooler kit is released, it will be with the same larger transmission cooler to work with either the factory intercooler or a PDI upgraded front mounted intercooler.

Crafted from 316-grade stainless steel and purge TIG-welded, the GTurbo Power Pipe is built for strength, durability, and clean airflow. The purge welding process ensures the inside of the pipe is smooth and free from dags, weld spatter, or debris that could compromise your engine. It is 4″ in diameter from the airbox, tapering to 3″ at the turbo inlet. A custom-engineered engine mount is included to relocate the mount, eliminating the clearance issues that force the factory intake to squash down to just 2”. The result is a high-flow, performance-focused intake that holds its shape under pressure, heat, and load. Why Upgrade? The factory intake pipe is mostly plastic and known to fail, especially over time. As it absorbs oil from the engine breather, it softens, then splits or collapses under load, a failure we’ve seen firsthand on the dyno. This can cause dust and debris to enter the turbo, reduce performance, and in extreme cases, lead to turbocharger or engine damage. The GTurbo Power Pipe offers: Significantly increased airflow, unlocking more power with tuning and supporting mods Reduced restriction, allowing the turbo and engine to work less for more airflow Superior reliability, with stainless construction that won’t soften, crack, or collapse Improved turbo efficiency, resulting in better throttle response, lower EGTs, and smoother power delivery Whether you’re chasing more power, better efficiency, or long-term reliability, the GTurbo Power Pipe is a critical upgrade for your VDJ build.",

Using the information obtained via the digital interface with the vehicle ECUs, it prevents activating the clutch during high slip conditions and only engages when within the same low slip limits the factory ECU uses. SafeLock® also ensures smooth transmission operation with no clunks or shift shock. Emergency Brake unlock feature hands control of the solenoid back to the factory computer ensures there is no interference with vehicle safety systems like Stability Control, Traction Control and ABS. ​ ​Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) solenoid control The electrical control of the solenoid uses the same PWM signal and engagement profile as the factory ECU to prevent damage to the solenoid (burnout). ​ Load Sensitivity The Isuzu is the only transmission we’ve found which will lose full lockup under load and slip the clutch. Load sensitivity is a critical feature of our kit to prevent clutch wear. With the Isuzu, a simple speed (KPH) based ON/OFF design risks clutch slip, even at 80-90 KPH. Lockup-mate®MX will automatically unlock under certain load conditions to protect the transmission from damage. No Error Codes When Isuzu transmission throws an error code the result is a very nasty clunk. lockup-mate®MX stays within the transmission’s acceptable performance limits to avoid error codes, so it will lockup in high range 3rd-6th gears, and will avoid lockup in 2nd and 4L and when full lockup is unsuitable for this vehicle. Advanced Digital ControlUsing advanced microcomputer control and digital CANBus communications with the vehicle’s computers, it works in harmony with the factory computers for maximum smoothness, to avoid error codes and prevent damage to the transmission. Flex-lockup mode of the transmission is still supported for maximum fuel savings. OBD2 Gauge PIDs lockup-mate®MX is like any other ECU on the CANBus so we’ve included the ability for your aftermarket OBD2 Gauge (eg UltraGaugeMX, ScanGauge 2/3, Car Scanner App) to read vehicle information from the lockup-mate®MX computer. Information available to display is lockup status, transmission temperature, load/pedal % (even with cruise control on), steering wheel angle, and actual gear. For 4JJ1 models it also includes the engine coolant temperature.",

      "description": "Description PDI Holden Colorado RG 2012+ / Holden Trailblazer 2012-2020 Heavy Duty Transmission Cooler The Holden Colorado 2012+ / Holden Trailblazer 2012-2020 PDI Heavy Duty Transmission Cooler boasts 48 plates in a 280x280x38mm core this unit is rated at 29,000BTU. This unit exceeds the efficiency rating of other single and dual cooler (run in series) systems on the market with the addition benefit of being stacked plate which also offers less restriction to flow. You may note that others aren’t specifying the unit rating which typically it is untested or they don’t want to make it easy to compare products. By default, all PDI external transmission coolers are design to be market leading through: · Maximum efficiency BTU (energy dissipation unit of measure) stacked plate coolers. These are the premium design cooler, notably better than “Tube and Fin” or “Plate and Fin” setups, known for being more efficient as well as being more expensive. · Steel one-piece brackets (zinc plated and coated) to eliminate flexing of the aluminium cooler. We don’t want stainless brackets that look cool but are brittle and cause corrosion to the steel parts they are bolted to. · High quality transmission cooler hose (rated to 400psi). · Optimised location with transmission cooler mounted in front of the hot side of the intercooler – this is to ensure it doesn’t put heat straight back into the intake air as higher intake temps mean torque is reduced and the transmission can make much more heat if this results in it coming out of lockup. · Outlets on either side or top to prevent air locks inside the transmission cooler. NOTE: Having the outlets at the bottom will make the installation easier as the pipes are run down under the radiator, BUT if you get an airlock (from initial installation empty) there is a strong chance you will never actually fill the top of the coolers with fluid and designed cooler efficiency may never be reached. · Designed to work with either the factory intercooler or a PDI upgraded front mounted intercooler. Suitable Holden Colorado and TrailBlazer RG 6 Speed Automatic 2012-current. For information on the upgraded PDI front mounted intercooler kit with stainless piping Click here",

The facelift model also saw a change to the radiator support panel, which allows us to fit the core further back without dropping the height (more than 20mm) and therefore allow the addition of the transmission cooler kit – see below if you have a PX1 as we think it should also fit there with some tweaks. The new core is 680 x 260 x 76 with slighter tighter end tank setup. This new design works with our class leading PDI transmission cooler kits, which need to be a serious consideration for any owners of the auto transmission model. For information on our transmission cooler kit CLICK HERE. Fully cast end tanks ensures they are the strongest possible and least likely to split along a seam. We have had the air temperature sensor cast into the end tank as well as a oil drain. All piping is stainless steel and the turbo side piping is rerouted to be significantly shorter and with a single 63mm pipe. Core is positioned further back at the bottom to allow the fitment of a winch.

After a few revisions this allowed us to get the maximum intercooler size and the placement is as high as we could get it. Placement is very important to maximise cooling, reduce potential for damage and to allow them to be fitted with winches. Inlet temps have dropped significantly and the owner reporting that “its like driving it on a cold day all the time now” with inlet air temps 4-6deg above ambient. The next generation of Prado (150 series) is factory fitted with a front mounted intercooler for the purpose of increase efficiency so this can now be experienced with the PDI intercooler in the 120 series Prado. Core is 600x265x76mm and is placed as high as possible for maximum exposure to cool air. We have utilised 63mm stainless piping where possible.",

      "description": "Description Hilux N70 KUN26 D4D Front Mount Intercooler Kit Mk 2 The PDI Mk2 Hilux front mount fits like a glove with: 600x300x76mm core (around 20% larger than competitors designs) custom high flow end tanks. 3” outlets into the engine bay. 2.5” stainless piping, thick 5 ply silicon and high torque Breeze liner clamps. After fitting to a couple of high powered Hilux’s, which already had a front mount intercooler, we have seen an increase in power delivery across the range as this larger core has allowed an even more aggressive tune. Sits neatly at the front. Uses zinc coated (and painted) mild steel brackets and a vertical support behind the intercooler to the lower crossmember to secure the bonnet latch. We don’t use stainless as it will cause the area around to start rusting due to cathodic reaction. Following upgrading to the larger Mk2 kit (from a 500mm wide core) it has been reported that the engine is more responsive across the whole rpm range. This is the largest core you can fit (possible due to our custom end tanks) and still retain the factory grill and any bumper/bullbar option. Additionally the tapering in of the headlight/grill line is matched by the end tanks to complement the design of the front of the vehicle. We have supplied intercoolers to highly modified 4WD where the owner is pushing the engine limits and running upwards of 60psi. Our cores have proved to be able to deal with the abuse an addition to amazing the customers with inlet air being so close to ambient both on the dyno and during use on the road/track/strip. Please see the cross-section picture of the core showing the mounting to help decide if this will fit with your winch.",

We have optimised the width of the core for maximum cooling and also to ensure we do not limit the flow through the condenser and radiator by blocking flow with the end tanks. Core is 680x280x76mm and sits on original factory mounts. 2.5” (63mm) mandrel bent stainless pipes for optimum flow. We choose stainless due to its extreme resistance to rubbing through. The factory setup has upper and lower flexible pipes on both sides to get down to the intercooler outlets. These have been replaced with one stainless pipe on each side and 5-ply flexible silicon. The inlet air pressure sensor is mounted into the fitting on the inlet manifold pipe. Clamps are all the highest torque rated Breeze units you can buy. The PDI ISUZU D-MAX Front mount Intercooler kit is winch compatible as it sits behind the factory centre support bracket. If you also wish to upgrade the transmission cooler we are developing a kit utilising a highly efficient cooler, with single piece zinc plated steel mounting bracket and positioned on the drivers side to prevent heat being place back into the air on the cold side of the intercooler. This will be better for intake temps when the transmission torque converter is working hard. Additionally the oil lines will be on the side (not the bottom) to prevent air locks within the transmission cooler. For details on PDI Transmission Cooler Kit Click here The PDI ISUZU D-MAX Front mount Intercooler upgrade will drop the inlet air temperature more than any other option on the market. The fitment is also the neatest and most durable setup. The core has mounting tabs cast into the end tanks and then precision machined.

      "description": "Description PDI Nissan Patrol Series 4 GU ZD30 CRD (& DI) TD42 Front Mount intercooler Kit PDI developed their new generation intercooler kit for the GU Patrol with an updated core design to give better clearance around the bullbar mounts and sat back further. It was also much bigger – around 40% larger frontal cross-sectional area than a “standard” 600x300mm core. The extra large core is 675 x 370 x 76 and is ideal for those needing the best intercooling for maximum efficiency gains. A smaller intercooler is ample for many customers who need a step above a top mount intercooler, so raised the bottom of the core 110mm (core dimensions 675 x 260 x 76). This design gives additional clearance to all bullbar and winch installs. Both of the above designs use the same intercooler outlet locations, but different piping for the TD42 or ZD30 CRD. The ZD30 has always been highly strung from the factory with rich air fuel ratios and relatively low boost they exhibit very high EGT – only turbo I’ve seen glowing red on the dyno. Once pushed a little harder the top mount design isn’t effective. Replacement top mounted designs aren’t a lot better and we’ve heard of lots of extra constant induction noise with the top mount intercooler. Our front mount is the solution to this as the drop in inlet air temperatures is significant resulting in much lower EGT and improved performance and noticeable economy improvements. The ZD30 kit features 2 1/2″ stainless pipework to and from the intercooler with the stainless necking down to 2” to roll over 180deg and line up with the turbo outlet. This means no elbows coming off the turbo getting blasted with a constant flow of hot air. Our silicon joiner here now has an oil resistant coating. Piping on turbo side briefly goes through the wheel arch but is in stainless so is very unlikely to get damaged. The inlet side piping is also 2.5” stainless and has a joiner in the middle. Two ports are located on the pipe before intake for connection to the MAP sensor and a spare outlet. The TD42 has long been a favourite and with the appropriate mods, can be a solid performer. Our front mounted intercooler will maintain cold day driving performance. We also run through the very front of the passenger side wheel arch area and into the engine bay. Connection to the turbo can be fun as there are many different turbo setups and orientations people run. We can supply an adapter to bold to the factory turbo outlet. The intake side has three parts with the top one being an intake adapter that bolts to the manifold. This adapter has a 1/8”NPT port with brass barb for a boost source. Patrol Series 1 from 1997 to April 2000 – please select alternate kit Patrol Series 2 from April 2000 to October 2001 – please select alternate kit Patrol Series 3 from October 2001 to October 2004 – please select alternate kit Patrol Series 4 from October 2004 to 2016 – PDI kit suitable for all Nissan diesel engines. Auto Transmission Cooler Options If you have an auto then by selection the auto option we will supply the standard kit with one for he best transmission coolers on the market (rated at 45,000BTU) and brackets that bolt to the intercooler with a series of holes that allow it to be located at three different heights. The lowest height places it down so only partially covering the bottom of the intercooler. If you choose to use the original (factory) transmission cooler then you will need to fabricate some brackets and we recommend placing it on the passenger side in front of the hot side of the intercooler. This means the intercooler still has a really good chance to cool the intake air from air heat extracted from the transmission. Thermo fan mounting Following from above for auto with factory transmission cooler or if running a manual gearbox, this gives room to place the thermo fan on the drivers side which means any air pushed through may add to intercooler efficiency, but it means that the cooler side of the intercooler will allow cooler air to pass through and help with air conditioner consdenser function. Our intercooler has 2 lugs on the top and 2 lugs on the bottom to Thermo fan mounting easier. If running aftermarket thermofans we highly recommend SPAL fans from Italy.",

Suitable for both high and low mounted turbos. The standard hot side piping has a 90deg silicon rescuer to go onto the turbo in the low mount configuration. If you have a high mounted turbo then we have seen people slightly adjust the stainless and change the orientation of the silicon to connect to the intercooler. The GQ Nissan Patrol TD42 PDI Front Mounted Intercooler Kit has 595 x 330 x 76 mm intercooler core Works with the factory air conditioning system in place. Fully cast alloy end tanks with recesses to allow it to sit back and maintain the factory look. Stainless pipe (polished) 2.5” Adapter to bolt onto the intake manifold.

Mild steel brackets – zinc plated and then painted black – no stainless brackets which are prone to fatigue crack and cause rusting of body panels due to anode/cathode reaction. Screw in oil drain on bottom of intercooler. The end result is an intercooler that will reduce intake temps to a minimum to maintain the performance only normally seen on cold days when driving unloaded. The increase in Mass air density will also allow more fuel to be added safely without risking excessive EGT. We would expect your EGT to drop 50-100deg.",

It was also much bigger – around 40% larger frontal cross-sectional area than a “standard” 600x300mm core. Unfortunately this will only fit in the front of the Series 4 due to the different upper radiator support panel and bonnet latch position.

We also run through the very front of the passenger side wheel arch area and into the engine bay. Connection to the turbo can be fun as there are many different turbo setups and orientations people run. We can supply an adapter to bold to the factory turbo outlet. The intake side has three parts with the top one being an intake adapter that bolts to the manifold. This adapter has a 1/8”NPT port with brass barb for a boost source.",

      "description": "Description PDI Landcruiser HDJ100 / 100 / 105 Series Front Mount Intercooler Mk2 1HD series core Core size: 675x300x76. Thats over 5.8 x greater surface area than the HDJ100 factory core, is thicker and better placed for increased cooling. Fits with all bull-bar and winch designs as the core sits back close to the condenser. Will fit a 100 series HDj100 with no modifications to the air conditioning system. If you have a 105 and would like to fit the large core, then the hose and piping from the condenser to the compressor needs to be replaced with the recessed HDJ100 pipe, or purchase a one piece replacement from us. Intercooler pipes: 2.5” stainless steel with heavy duty silicon joiners. Silicon selection now simplified with no silicon in front of the front panel. High torque stainless steel clamps. The moulded end tanks with rear facing outlets have enabled a bigger core, then we pushed it back as far as possible to increase the draw through from the engine cooling fan. With the outlets being rear facing, the stainless steel pipes are connected to the intercooler with straight silicon. During testing we have seen this maintain intake temps to 4-7degC above ambient temperature for normal around town driving. When under load (on the highway towing a heavy trailer) running a steady 15-18psi with 150degC the intake temps sat 15deg above ambient. On a 20degC the intake temps got up to 35deg – you’ll have to trust us, but that’s really impressive. For HZJ105 running the 1HZ engine we suggest our smaller core (645x240x65) to reduce the heat loading on the radiator. While it is not as effective as our larger core, most 1HZ aren’t pushed too hard and this core will easily cater for almost all turbo 1HZ builds. This core is designed to fit around the condenser pipe. Air can be felt strongly pulling through the intercooler 50-80mm in front of the core, while idling on startup. To continue to have the air being pulled through while engine temps are low (and the fan hub normally free wheels) some extra fluid can be added to the viscous coupling. The early 100 series didn’t have any power steering cooler pipes out front and most owners leave it like that. If you have or want to maintain the power steering pipe cooler this need to be routed through the opening for the passenger side headlight. A crossover delete option is available (extra $150) for the 1HD-FTE. All 1HZ / 1HD-T / 1HD-FT are crossover delete design as standard and has no extra fee. CROSSOVER DELETE OPTION For the 1HDFTE, PDI give the option of leaving the crossover in place (with the EGR valve) or a cast alloy adapter onto the inlet manifold for all of the cruiser models (80/75/79100/105). If you would like the crossover delete please CLICK HERE and add to you cart. The 1HDFTE in our HDJ79 ute has the crossover in place and has 311rwkw and 1000nm (at the wheels). I’m sure there is a point where air flow is better without the crossover but I don’t believe we are there yet. Leaving the crossover in place is good for: 1. Legally it has to be there since the EGR valve is in the crossover – you can still stop EGR gas flow with the valve in place. 2. No more power is made by removing the crossover (for most people) 3. Smooth shutdown is possible with the crossover and butterfly in place. 4. If the engine ever runs on its own fumes (and I’ve seen two FTEs do that) then turning off the key turns off the engine. 5. If it’s the late model with electronic butterfly then it must remain plugged in to the harness. 6. If you need to pass a pit inspection the crossover must be fitted. AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION COOLER The transmission coolers available to fit with our kits are the best we could find and we give the option of two versions for the 100/105 series. The standard one is the same as is used in the 80 series kits and we get reports that transmission temps have dropped after fitting our intercooler and trans cooler. As well as the trans cooler being very good we also expect the transmission can hold the gear for longer and stay in lock-up, which reduces heat being made. From the pictures you can see we have chosen to have them in front of the intercooler. The auto cooler bracket has six options with three different positions for either of the two transmission coolers. We recommend having them in the lower position to prevent heat transfer into the intercooler but if other items such as winches are fitted it would be good idea to have the transmission cooler lifted up for better cooling. HD Transcooler Option. PLATES DESIGN DIMENSIONS HEAT DISSIPATION RATING 13 plate Stacked Plate 560mm x 215mm x 32mm 45,000BTU This is the best cooler we have ever seen and does an exceptional job at dropping transmission temperatures. A number of years ago, a friend needed massive cooling for his offroad race vehicle, which was auto and running a high powered FTE engine – in my 1 ride in this vehicle out the back of “the pines”, as well as being fast in and out of the corners, I just thought how hard he was on the transmission. He asked for a large (550x300x76mm) bar and plate intercooler, which he sealed the outlets and ran transmission fluid through it. After a few races he decided he needed more cooling so we supplied the 45,000BTU transmission cooler above, which he claimed made a big difference. A couple years later, he reported that at some point, due to mounting and the weight of the fluid filled intercooler it formed a crack, so he had to bypass it during a race and it made no difference to the overall cooling as the properly designed and suitably sized stacked plate core did such a good job. At that point the much larger bar and plate cooler was never refitted. The ideal operating temperature for automatic transmission fluid is somewhere between 80 and 110 degrees C. Here’s what can happen above this range: At approximately 115 degrees C, important additives begin to cook in the automatic transmission fluid (ATF). The result is the formation of varnish inside the transmission. At approximately 125 degrees C, internal transmission seals, which are often manufactured from a polyacrylate material, begin to harden. The end results are internal and external leaks as the the seals lose their elasticity. At approximately 145 degrees C, transmission clutch plates begin to slip because the oil is breaking down further. At approximately 160 degrees C, seals and clutches effectively burn out. Carbon forms in the oil and your effectively killed the transmission. Often, a transmission will die within a few thousand km after experiencing 150-plus degree heat. It is worth noting that the AT temp warning light on a 4 speed auto Landcruiser came on at 150degC and that generally means you are well beyond a safe temperature.",

      "description": "Description PDI Landcruiser HDJ79 Front Mount Intercooler Kit HDJ78 / HDJ79 / HZJ79 The PDI Landcruiser HDJ79 Front Mount intercooler kit is the neatest and most effective intercooler kits to suit your 73, 75, 77, 78 or 79 series narrow nose cruiser. If you have a 75 series you can choose our other product (75 Series kits) The PDI Landcruiser HDJ79 Front Mount intercooler kit for the 6 cylinder narrow nose 70 series sits directly behind the factory grill for maximum cooling potential and will not interfere with other installed items such as lights or a winch. This is possible with the relocation of air conditioner piping and the drier to the engine bay. All parts required to mount the intercooler and relocate the intercooler are included in the kit. This includes three flexible hoses and the drier for moving the air conditioner piping from behind the grill. Long term testing has shown this to be highly effective for the inlet air temperatures and for the function of the air conditioner itself with no impact on the radiators ability to keep the engine cool. The cores are 600mm x 240mm, which fills the space available at the front. Our front mount kit cooling capability is greater than all other kits we have tested so the improvements in torque and power will exceed other results. PDI kits use moulded end tanks to get maximum width. We limit the height to the grill opening and stay away from extending the core down to sit both behind the front panel and/or in front of the horizontal crossmember, which means cooling flow isn’t restricted. Other kits, which don’t get the same unrestricted flow, would expect to see dilution of the chilled air with air that hasn’t been able to be effectively cooled therefore becoming less efficient. Customers and tuners are amazed how well our PDI systems work. Being neat, as per factory finish, adds to the appeal. Once fitted are a zero maintenance setup, and still allow access into the engine bay for any maintenance or inspection. For those with factory turbo engines (1HDFTE standard or converted to 1HDT or 1HDFT) we have 76mm cores. Black cores are available, black piping is not standard. CROSSOVER DELETE OPTION For the 1HDFTE, PDI give the option of leaving the crossover in place (with the EGR valve) or a forward facing cast alloy adapter onto the inlet manifold for all of the cruiser models (80 / 75 / 79 / 100 / 105). The PDI adapter has mounting for 2 pressure ports, intake air temp sensor plus a mounting for MAP sensor and MAP sensor filter – the later 2 are to enable correct draining and to keep these items on the engine for wiring longevity. The 1HDFTE in our HDJ79 ute has the standard crossover in place and has 311rwkw and 1000nm (at the wheels). Maybe once rear wheel power exceeds 450hp, the crossover will become a restriction, but the FTE injection pump doesn’t have enough fuel for that. Leaving the crossover in place is good for: 1. Legally it has to be there since the EGR valve is in the crossover – you can still stop EGR gas flow with the valve in place. 2. No more power is made by removing the crossover (for most people) 3. Smooth shutdown is possible with the crossover and butterfly in place. 4. If the engine ever runs on its own fumes (and I’ve seen two FTEs do that) then turning off the key turns off the engine. 5. If it’s the late model with electronic butterfly then it must remain plugged in to the harness. 6. If you need to pass a pit inspection the crossover must be fitted. We would suggest only removing the crossover if it aesthetically bothers you. Our test HDJ79 cruiser fitted with the PDI Landcruiser HDJ79 Front Mount intercooler kit is putting down 300rwkw on heavy mud tyres that suck an additional 15rwkw. This allows us to get some high load testing done and also be assured that not many are going to push it harder than we do – hopefully by then we will be pushing it harder too. The power output for the 1HDFTE in the ute and troopy was set to be 122kW (at the engine), down from 151kW in the 100 series with the factory fitted intercooler. This normally equates to 90rwkw and 110rwkw, respectively, after drivetrain power loss. Our first released PDI Landcruiser HDJ79 Front Mount intercooler kit had a 600x240x65mm core and now we have managed to fit a 76mm thick core behind the factory grill (with a bit of slimming to the plastic), which for many who have considered the custom install to be impossible. The pipework is also 2 1/2” stainless steel for improved flow and durability. Note stock levels of the 76mm core have been depleted and we have 65mm cores Initial testing of the system was with an upgraded Gturbo Badboy turbo, tuning module, Safari ARMax snorkel and running standard injectors and standard airbox. Dyno testing with this configuration has resulted in a max power of 186.4kW at the wheels with a low 20psi boost. We also managed to achieve 18psi at 1550rpm with maximum torque of 668Nm at (only) 1850rpm. There is no doubt this is has to be one of the best combinations for a “mildly modified” 1HDFTE that boasts only 122kW at the engine (100rwkw) in factory form. Our next step was to install +30% injectors. There is a step change in performance with this upgrade and needs a retune. With a few changes we managed to get 246rwkw (330hp at the wheels) and 900nm so an excellent result. The current setup is running +70% injectors and has 311rwkw and over 1000nm. The 76mm core will make that even easier, with larger end tanks and better internal flow for high boost. To make space for the intercooler core, the air conditioner piping has to be rerouted. The components to do this are included in the kit and the task is simple enough. Spacers are provided to space the radiator back at the top. Then the condenser has a few spacers and longer bolts to allow that to also be pushed back so that nothing touches. The condenser stays in place and flexible lines take care of the rest of the relocating. Initial testing on two different cruisers resulted in the fitter doing the regassing comment on how well the system was performing. With the installation of the core up front it continues to work really well – on a hot day it is the place to be. With the ambient temperature 33-37deg a heavy tandem axle trailer was hitched up to increase load. Post turbo inlet Post intercooler inlet temperatures Normal around town driving 50-150degC 42-46degC Highway normal driving (towing) 90-160degC 48-52degC Max load up long hill 180degC 60degC Under full load thats 36% more air going into the engine, which will result in a significantly improved EGT with the same fuel or add more fuel to make even more power. For those running standard injectors this is an excellent improvement. All these results were using a 500mm wide core. We have done some more testing of the current 600mm wide core now that we can apply more load. When working hard the turbo outlet temp was pushed to 260degC and post intercooler temps were down to 70degC – a 190degC reduction. The results below show how effective the PDI front mount is compared to top mounted configuration. Compare this to one of the mid size current top mount setups that had turbo outlet temp of 130degC and post intercooler temp of 90degC – a 40degC reduction. We have tested the largest top mount offering and with around 150rwkw the post turbo temp was up to 190degC and the post intercooler temp was 75degC – a 115degC reduction. Further testing with the high flow injectors has seen the intake temperatures pulled down from 250-260degC to 70 degC on a 28degC day. That is significant. A top mount under the same conditions is expected to be no better than 140degC. If your preference is to get rid of the factory intake crossover pipe (for the EGR system) a forward facing alloy adapter off the intake manifold can be supplied. If you’re looking here then you’ve probably worked out that our front mounts will out perform any top mount intercoolers. Next thing is to work out what differentiates PDI from other front mount options. Bonnet latch is support with solid steel brackets from lower crossmember. We do not use the intercooler to absorb the shocks of bonnet bounce. We maximise the size of the core behind the grill opening and have been seeing results far more impressive than the smaller core should be producing. Our custom cast end tanks were designed to give us maximum width. While it is possible to make the core taller by going down further, an examination of the space will show that a 40mm portion of the extended core is blocked off from behind by the crossmember. The area that goes below the crossmember is then also blocked from the front by the lower painted panel and additionally it is unlikely to have any cooling from the air being pulled by the fan from behind. This portion of intercooler which does not see the same cooling as the upper part can have the affect of diluting the air charge with air that has not been cooled as much and therefore. Cast end tanks are used as airflow will be smoother, especially while going between the tank and welded pipe. No welds means a stronger tank that won’t bust open along the seems at high boost. We have chosen to go through the front panel down low as this is the simplest penetration (with an existing hole 38mm diameter) and has limited impact on the structure. The 75/79 series six cylinder radiator is mainly supported from the top mount so strength here is important. We have seen custom installs that may look great, but no only do they go through next to the radiator mounts, they also cut away a large portion of the lower crossmember, which is a major structural component. For these custom setups, although the rear of the crossmember is kept, there is no flow through a 50mm horizontal section of the core as it is blocked from the front and the back. Our stainless pipework is all one piece with no welding. The stainless routing goes over and points down at the turbo outlet so we can use a straight connection in silicon. This routing also works with a range of airboxes including factory, Moonlight and our soon to be released PDI airbox. The fact that a factory grill can be modified to fit over our intercooler is great. It means you don’t have to work out what colour to paint the intercooler core or custom grill so it looks like a Landcruiser.",

For those running standard injectors this is an excellent improvement. All these results were using a 500mm wide core. We have done some more testing of the current 600mm wide core now that we can apply more load. When working hard the turbo outlet temp was pushed to 260degC and post intercooler temps were down to 70degC – a 190degC reduction. The results below show how effective the PDI front mount is compared to top mounted configuration. Compare this to one of the mid size current top mount setups that had turbo outlet temp of 130degC and post intercooler temp of 90degC – a 40degC reduction. We have tested the largest top mount offering and with around 150rwkw the post turbo temp was up to 190degC and the post intercooler temp was 75degC – a 115degC reduction. Further testing with the high flow injectors has seen the intake temperatures pulled down from 250-260degC to 70 degC on a 28degC day. That is significant. A top mount under the same conditions is expected to be no better than 140degC. If you’re looking here then you’ve probably worked out that our front mounts will out perform any top mount intercoolers. Next thing is to work out what differentiates PDI from other front mount options. Bonnet latch is support with solid steel brackets from lower crossmember. We do not use the intercooler to absorb the shocks of bonnet bounce. We maximise the size of the core behind the grill opening and have been seeing results far more impressive than the smaller core should be producing. Our custom cast end tanks were designed to give us maximum width. While it is possible to make the core taller by going down further, an examination of the space will show that a 40mm portion of the extended core is blocked off from behind by the crossmember. The area that goes below the crossmember is then also blocked from the front by the lower painted panel and additionally it is unlikely to have any cooling from the air being pulled by the fan from behind. This portion of intercooler which does not see the same cooling as the upper part can have the affect of diluting the air charge with air that has not been cooled as much and therefore. Cast end tanks are used as airflow will be smoother, especially while going between the tank and welded pipe. No welds means a stronger tank that won’t bust open along the seems at high boost. We have chosen to go through the front panel down low as this is the simplest penetration (with an existing hole 38mm diameter) and has limited impact on the structure. The 75/79 series six cylinder radiator is mainly supported from the top mount so strength here is important. We have seen custom installs that may look great, but no only do they go through next to the radiator mounts, they also cut away a large portion of the lower crossmember, which is a major structural component. For these custom setups, although the rear of the crossmember is kept, there is no flow through a 50mm horizontal section of the core as it is blocked from the front and the back. Our stainless pipework is all one piece with no welding. The stainless routing goes over and points down at the turbo outlet so we can use a straight connection in silicon. This routing also works with a range of airboxes including factory, Moonlight and our soon to be released PDI airbox. The fact that a factory grill can be modified to fit over our intercooler is great. It means you don’t have to work out what colour to paint the intercooler core or custom grill so it looks like a Landcruiser.",

The PDI Landcruiser VDJ79 Front mount intercooler provides the best intercooling for both high load and low speed work. The core sits close to the condenser which results in air being pulled through by the engine’s main cooling fan.

      "description": "Description PDI 200 Series Landcruiser Front Mount Intercooler Kit The PDI front mount for the 200 series is custom designed for the 200 series. The end tanks wrap around the factory components and aim to provide cool air under high load situations to maintain torque and power when its most needed. The core is pushed back close to the radiator and condenser to get maximum air flow. With the release in 2019 of the Mk2 design the results have been amazing, making it a critical ingredient, if pushing 400hp at the wheels or doing heavy towing. In fact the first upgraded turbos for the 200 series were not developed until we had released a front mount kit. PDI currently offer 2 options: Mk2 Standard is 610x320x76mm. This design is slightly bigger and requires room to run the pipe across the front to get air from the passenger side turbo into the intercooler. Mk2 Slimline is 610x285x76mm. The core is slightly smaller vertically so we can do away with the pipe across the front and give room for the current range of bull-bars with winches. Additionally we have updated the centre bracket and provided the option of a HD transmission cooler or to keep the factory transmission cooler. Pipework is all stainless steel for longevity and durability. Quality USA made Breeze clamps and silicon is thick 5ply to ensure the setup is trouble free. This is the next generation for even more cooling ability and with enhancements such as: • improved drivability and performance increase across the rev range. • recessed design for max draw through from main engine fan for better slow speed cooling • transmission cooler location improved to sit directly behind the grill to prioritise cooling. • easier fitting. To confirm the clearance for the Std model PDI intercooler you will need 90mm in front of the lower radiator support. Additionally you will need 145mm (towards drivers side in RHD vehicle) from the 8mm mounting bolt to ensure clearance around the bullbar mount. The 200 series Landcruiser is a solid vehicle with good power and torque, suitable for towing heavy loads in comfort. When considering performance upgrades, the first step in performance should be an ECU reflash, which is an effective and simple solution where boost and fuel are increased above standard – both of these will result in an increase in inlet air temperature. If you wish to maintain the thermo fan at the front then 2 lugs are on the passenger side of the intercooler to assist in the mounting of a Spal VA10-AP10/C-61S 12V. This is on the cold side of the intercooler so will still allow cool air to reach the condenser under most driving conditions. We suggest not running any other brand of thermo fan, regardless of rating. Why go front mounted? Toyota placed the intercooler on the top of the engine since it met the requirements they had for the standard power ratings on these engines for most users. It also helped to keep production and assembly costs lower. It was not chosen as the most effective solution. Where efficiency is required to achieve good results (from smaller engines) manufacturers delivered the vehicles with front mounting intercoolers such as Hilux, Prado, D-Max, Colorado, Ford Ranger and many others. With the standard top mount intercooler, the 200 series performance suffers with increased ambient temperature and load. While towing, the constant higher boost produces more heat than can be dissipated by a top mounted intercooler. At low speed the problem is worse, as the design of the front ducting for the factory intercooler is sealed to below the top of the grill so hot air from the engine is trapped around the core until you start moving. Placing any obstruction (such as a bullbar) in front of the entry at the top of the grill additionally affects getting any cool air moving over the core. We’ve never heard of a top mounted radiator and that’s because the cold air isn’t there. Testing, performed on a VDJ70 series, running the same engine and intercooler as the 200 series and tuned to around 150rwkw (similar to the 200 series) showed that (at full load) the factory top mount was able to cool the pressurised inlet air charge from around 180-190degC down to 88degC. A quality aftermarket top mount further brought this temp down to 75degC – a 15% drop in maximum temperature. On the same vehicle, our PDI front mount was tested and the temperature reached a maximum of 47degC, which is a 46% drop in temperature, being over 3x more effective than a quality aftermarket upgraded top mounted intercooler. The benefit of front mounting is even greater with further power increases as the boost is higher and the heat to be removed increases. The 76mm thick core is huge, utilising the large frontal area on a full size Landcruiser to maximise cooling, improve air fuel ratios and drop your EGT. The setup is ideal for safely optimising your performance aims or for towing applications and requires minimal modification for installation. The kit brings the air charge from the two turbos into the drivers side and runs across through the intercooler. The outlet has a single feed back into the engine bay to go through either the OEM twin throttle bodies or our single entry design. The dual entry allows your EGR system and soft shutdown to remain in place. The single entry is a neater installation and will give better low and mid throttle response. For chipped or re-flashed 200 series they can make over 200rwkw, but with very rich mixtures and expected high exhaust temps. Improved intercooling will bring reduce EGT by leaning out the mixtures. This is especially true for those doing any high load or low speed work with their 200 series as air flow over the top mount is reduced. The front location is where the coolest air is, with limited heat soak from the engine. Even at low speed or when stationary, on the dyno, our PDI front mounted intercoolers can be expected to give the most consistently high power and torque results. Once on the road it only gets better. Too many times it’s been said that top mounts work better at low speed. We have yet to see a top mounted intercooler to compete with the efficiency and found that top mounted intercoolers efficiency deteriorates rapidly at high load typically seen when trying to go faster. We have kits available to send out. SINGLE ENTRY OR DUAL ENTRY The single and dual entry kits use the same intercooler and same hot side piping to the turbo – only the cold side piping is different. The factory setup has two throttle bodies facing left and right which go into the factory top mounted intercooler. The dual entry option connect into both of these, but splits the outlet from the intercooler. The single entry removes the butterflies and the section they bolt to, which also has the feed from the EGR (exhaust gas recirculation emissions system) so the EGR input becomes blocked off with a plate and will not flow any exhaust gases into the intake. For all 200 series and post 2013 VDJ79/76/78 the two throttle bodies must be plugged back in to prevent the engine throwing codes and de-rating the power. For early 70 series they can be left off the engine with an ECU reflash to clear the fault from them not being connected. We supply a bracket to mount the throttle bodies and hang either side of the single entry intake adapter. Reason to go with the single entry kit Chasing max responsiveness and have high flow turbos. The factory throttles are only fully open when your foot is flat to the floor. The rest of the time they are moving to assist with EGR flow. Looking to have the neatest intercooler piping, with less connections. Reason to go dual entry (or why not to go single entry): Want to keep the EGR system connected to intake to meet emissions requirements. Want to keep the butterflies (throttle valves) in the system to give smooth shut down, maintain factory setup and for those with auto transmission, maintain the ability to shut down the engine in case it ever starts to run on its own fumes (this is a low probability, but high risk outcome).",
